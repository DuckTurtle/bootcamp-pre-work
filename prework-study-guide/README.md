# UW Bootcamp Pre-work Website

## Description
This webstite is one of the first steps on my jurny to learn to code. I created it to organise my notes to use as a refrance later down the road if I ever forget the basics.
Building this website has helped me learn the basics for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. By organising my notes in the form of a website I can easly refrance them later from anywhere, it also allows me to share my notes with anyone with only a url.

## Installation

For this project you can either access the Webpage from any browser, or you can download/copy the files from Git Hub and launch the website directly from your computer.

## Usage
 The only feature that isn't readly accesable in the main page is the consol list and study topic genarator. To access those you simply need to right click on the webpage, hit inspect at the bottem of the list that pops up, then at the top of the elements page click the consol button. The randomly genarated study topic will already be ther in text uder the list of possable topics.
